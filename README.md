# AxonFlow

> Self-hosted governance and orchestration for production AI systems.

## TL;DR

- **What:** A control plane that sits between your app and LLM providers, applying real-time policy enforcement and orchestration
- **How it works:** Runs AI workflows end-to-end as a control plane, with an optional gateway mode for incremental adoption
- **How it runs:** Docker Compose locally, no signup, no license key required
- **Core features:** Policy enforcement (PII, injection attacks), audit trails, multi-model routing, multi-agent planning
- **License:** BSL 1.1 (source-available) — converts to Apache 2.0 after 4 years
- **Not for:** Hobby scripts or single-prompt experiments — built for teams taking AI to production

*AxonFlow is implemented in Go as a long-running control plane, with client SDKs for **Python**, **TypeScript**, **Go**, and **Java**.*

---

## Why This Exists

Most agent frameworks optimize for authoring workflows, not operating them.
Once agents touch real systems, teams run into familiar problems: partial failures, retries with side effects, missing permissions, and no runtime visibility.

AxonFlow treats agents as long-running, stateful systems that require governance, observability, and control at runtime — not just good prompts.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and start
git clone https://github.com/getaxonflow/axonflow.git
cd axonflow
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here  # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
docker-compose up -d

# Verify it's running
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8081/health
```

**That's it.** Agent runs on `:8080`, Orchestrator on `:8081`.

### Supported LLM Providers

| Provider | Community | Enterprise | Notes |
|----------|:---------:|:----------:|-------|
| **OpenAI** | ✅ | ✅ | GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 |
| **Anthropic** | ✅ | ✅ | Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus |
| **Azure OpenAI** | ✅ | ✅ | Azure AI Foundry & Classic endpoints |
| **Google Gemini** | ✅ | ✅ | Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini Pro |
| **Ollama** | ✅ | ✅ | Local/air-gapped deployments |
| **AWS Bedrock** | ❌ | ✅ | HIPAA-compliant, data residency |

### See Governance in Action (30 seconds)

```bash
# Example: Send a request containing an SSN — AxonFlow blocks it before it reaches an LLM
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/policy/pre-check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_token": "demo-user", "client_id": "demo-client", "query": "Look up customer with SSN 123-45-6789"}'
```

```json
{"approved": false, "block_reason": "PII detected: ssn", "policies": ["pii_ssn_detection"]}
```

### Full Interactive Demo (10 min)

Experience the complete governance suite: PII detection, SQL injection blocking,
proxy and gateway modes, MCP connectors, multi-agent planning, and observability.

```bash
# Create .env with your API key (containers read from this file at startup)
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY" > .env

# Restart services to load the key
docker compose up -d --force-recreate

# Run the interactive demo
./examples/demo/demo.sh
```

The demo walks through a realistic customer support scenario with live LLM calls.
See [`examples/demo/README.md`](examples/demo/README.md) for options (`--quick`, `--part N`).

---

AxonFlow runs inline with LLM traffic, enforcing policies and routing decisions in single-digit milliseconds — fast enough to prevent failures rather than observe them after the fact.

---

## Who This Is For

**Good fit:**
- Production AI teams needing governance before shipping
- Platform teams building internal AI infrastructure
- Regulated industries (healthcare, finance, legal) with compliance requirements
- Teams wanting audit trails and policy enforcement without building it themselves

**Not a good fit:**
- Single-prompt experiments or notebooks
- Prototypes where governance isn't a concern yet
- Projects where adding a service layer is overkill

---

## What AxonFlow Does

**Policy Enforcement** — Block SQL injection, detect PII (SSN, credit cards, PAN/Aadhaar), enforce rate limits. Policies apply before requests reach LLMs.

**SQL Injection Response Scanning** — Detect SQLi payloads in MCP connector responses. Protects against data exfiltration when compromised data is returned from databases.

**Code Governance** — Detect LLM-generated code, identify language and security issues (secrets, eval, shell injection). Logged for compliance.

**Audit Trails** — Every request logged with full context. Know what was blocked, why, and by which policy. Token usage tracked for cost analysis.

**Decision & Execution Replay** — Debug governed workflows with step-by-step state and policy decisions. Timeline view and compliance exports included.

**Cost Controls** — Set budgets at org, team, agent, or user level. Track LLM spend across providers with configurable alerts and enforcement actions.

**Multi-Model Routing** — Route requests across OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Ollama based on cost, capability, or compliance requirements. Failover included.

**Multi-Agent Planning** — Define agents in YAML, let AxonFlow turn natural language requests into executable workflows.

**Proxy Mode** — Full request lifecycle: policy, planning, routing, audit. Recommended for new projects.

**Gateway Mode** — Governance for existing stacks (LangChain, CrewAI). Pre-check → your call → audit.

### vs LangChain / LangSmith

| Feature | AxonFlow | LangChain/LangSmith |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Governance** | Inline policy enforcement | Post-hoc monitoring |
| **Architecture** | Active prevention | Passive detection (observability) |
| **Enterprise Focus** | Built for compliance & security first | Developer-first framework |
| **Multi-Tenant** | Production-ready isolation | DIY multi-tenancy |
| **Self-Hosted** | Full core available | Partial (monitoring requires cloud) |

**The Key Difference:** LangChain/LangSmith focus on observability and post-hoc analysis, while AxonFlow enforces policies inline during request execution.

**Best of Both Worlds:** Many teams use LangChain for orchestration logic with AxonFlow as the governance layer on top.

## Community vs Enterprise

Community is for experimentation and validation. Enterprise is what IT, security, and compliance require for production rollout.

### Stay on Community if:
- Single team prototyping AI features
- No centralized identity or IT controls required
- No regulatory or audit requirements

### You need Enterprise when:

**Identity & Organization Controls**
- SSO + SAML authentication
- SCIM user lifecycle management
- Multi-tenant isolation

**Compliance & Risk**
- EU AI Act conformity workflows + 10-year retention
- SEBI/RBI compliance exports + 5-year retention
- Human-in-the-Loop approval queues
- Emergency circuit breaker (kill switch)

**Platform & Operations**
- One-click AWS CloudFormation deployment
- Usage analytics and cost attribution
- Priority support with SLA
- Customer Portal UI for runtime management

### Public Issues (Technical Questions Welcome)

If you're evaluating AxonFlow and encounter unclear behavior, edge cases, or questions around guarantees (e.g. policy enforcement, audit semantics, failure modes), opening a GitHub issue is welcome.

We're especially interested in questions that surface ambiguous semantics or runtime edge cases rather than general feedback.

### Private Evaluation Questions

If you're evaluating AxonFlow internally and prefer not to open a public issue, you can reach us at hello@getaxonflow.com.

This channel is intended for technical questions about semantics, guarantees, or runtime behavior. We treat these as engineering discussions, not sales conversations.
