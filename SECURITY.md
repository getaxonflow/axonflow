# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The AxonFlow team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

**security@getaxonflow.com**

You should receive a response within **48 hours**. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours of report
- **Triage:** Within 5 business days, we will confirm the vulnerability and determine severity
- **Fix Development:** Depends on severity (Critical: 7 days, High: 14 days, Medium: 30 days)
- **Public Disclosure:** After fix is deployed and users have time to update (typically 30-90 days)

### Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels:

- **Critical:** Vulnerabilities that allow remote code execution, complete system compromise, or unauthorized data access at scale
- **High:** Vulnerabilities that allow significant unauthorized access to data or system functionality
- **Medium:** Vulnerabilities that allow limited unauthorized access or minor information disclosure
- **Low:** Vulnerabilities with minimal security impact

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours
2. We will confirm the vulnerability and determine its severity
3. We will work on a fix and keep you updated on progress
4. Once a fix is ready, we will coordinate the release timeline with you
5. We will publicly acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Bug Bounty

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program. However, we deeply appreciate security researchers' efforts and will:

- Publicly acknowledge security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities (with permission)
- Consider offering rewards for critical vulnerabilities on a case-by-case basis
- Provide AxonFlow swag and extended trial licenses to researchers who help improve our security

### Scope

The following are **in scope** for security reports:

- AxonFlow Agent (API gateway component)
- AxonFlow Orchestrator (routing and policy enforcement)
- AxonFlow SDKs (TypeScript, Go)
- Customer Portal (backend and frontend)
- MCP Connectors (PostgreSQL, Redis, Salesforce, Snowflake, Amadeus, etc.)

## Security Architecture

### Overview

AxonFlow implements a **prevention-first security architecture** with sub-10ms inline governance. Unlike passive monitoring tools that detect issues after damage is done, AxonFlow provides active prevention through real-time intervention.

For detailed information, see:
- [Threat Model and Data Flow Analysis](technical-docs/THREAT_MODEL_AND_DATA_FLOW.md)
- [Security Architecture Overview](technical-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

### Core Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions by default
3. **Zero Trust**: Verify every request, never assume trust
4. **Encryption Everywhere**: Data protected at rest and in transit
5. **Audit Everything**: Immutable logs for compliance
6. **Fail Secure**: System defaults to secure state on errors

### Trust Boundaries

- **External → Agent**: Public internet to API gateway (TLS 1.3)
- **Agent → Orchestrator**: Internal network (mutual TLS optional)
- **Orchestrator → Database**: Encrypted connections (SSL required)
- **Orchestrator → LLM Providers**: HTTPS with API key rotation

---

## Security Features

AxonFlow includes comprehensive security features by default:

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

## Security Best Practices for Users

If you're deploying AxonFlow:

### Critical Security Controls

1. **Use Strong Secrets**
   - Generate cryptographically secure JWT secrets (minimum 32 bytes)
   - Use AWS Secrets Manager random password generation
   - Never commit secrets to version control

2. **Enable HTTPS**
   - Always use TLS/SSL in production (CloudFormation templates enforce this)
   - Use AWS Certificate Manager for free SSL certificates
   - Enable HTTP to HTTPS redirect

3. **Rotate Credentials**
   - Rotate license keys at least annually
   - Enable AWS Secrets Manager automatic rotation
   - Rotate database passwords every 90 days

4. **Monitor Audit Logs**
   - Review audit logs regularly for suspicious activity
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for anomalies
   - Export logs to SIEM for long-term analysis

5. **Update Regularly**
   - Keep AxonFlow updated to the latest stable version
   - Subscribe to security advisories
   - Test updates in staging before production

6. **Restrict Network Access**
   - Use VPC configurations to limit access to internal networks only
   - Use security groups to whitelist specific IP ranges
   - Enable VPC endpoints to avoid internet exposure

7. **Enable Compliance Mode**
   - Use synchronous audit logging for regulated industries
   - Configure appropriate log retention periods
   - Enable PII redaction for sensitive data
