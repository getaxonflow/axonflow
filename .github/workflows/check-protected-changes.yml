            This PR modifies coverage thresholds in \`.github/workflows/test.yml\`.

            **This requires explicit approval from @saurabhjain1592.**

            Per project policy:
            - Coverage thresholds should NOT be lowered without explicit approval
            - If coverage is failing, add more tests instead of lowering thresholds
            - Current thresholds: Agent 74%, Orchestrator 72%, Connectors 55%

            If this change is intentional and approved, please add a comment confirming.`;
