# <type>(<scope>): <subject> (max 72 chars)
# |<----  Using a Maximum Of 72 Characters  ---->|

# Body: Explain *what* and *why* (not *how*)
# Wrap at 72 characters

# Footer: Reference issues, PRs, breaking changes
# Example: Closes #123, Fixes #456

# --- COMMIT END ---
# Type can be:
#   feat     (new feature)
#   fix      (bug fix)
#   docs     (documentation)
#   style    (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
#   refactor (refactoring production code)
#   test     (adding tests, refactoring tests)
#   chore    (updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc.)
#   perf     (performance improvement)
# --------------------
# Scope examples:
#   agent, orchestrator, dashboard, deploy, policy, audit, security, docs
# --------------------
# Remember to:
#   - Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
#   - Don't end the subject line with a period
#   - Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   - Keep detailed bodies (AxonFlow strength!)
#   - Reference issues and PRs in the footer
